# characterMakerDB

My latest project. The idea is to be able to make characters for the TTRPG Dungeons and Dragons. 3.5 Edition.

Currently just throwing a bunch of ideas around.

Will attempt to update this repository at least twice a week.

dbtest.py is currently the only file accessing the database.

Theoretically main will tie all the functionality together.
